# Contributing
Before I get started, thank you for contributing! :)

## Issues
For any typos, errors, or new feature suggestions feel free to open a new issue.

## Pull Requests
I'm not very picky about how you should contribute, but I ask that the following are met:
* Proper spelling and grammar.
* If it's a language or library feature that you can write code with, please provide an
example of its usage. An optimal submission would also include a short real-world use case for the feature.
* Make sure the feature is in the correct C++ version.
* Make sure you've added the feature to the table of contents.
* Make sure you have also added the feature to the separate major C++ readme files (ie. CPP11.md, CPP14.md, etc.).
